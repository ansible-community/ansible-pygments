This project provides a [Pygments] lexer that is able to handle
[Ansible] output. It may be used anywhere Pygments is integrated.
The lexer is registered globally under the name `ansible-output`.

It also provides a [Pygments] style for tools needing to highlight
code snippets.

The code is licensed under the terms of the [BSD 2-Clause license].

## Using the lexer in [Sphinx]

Make sure this library in installed in the same env as your [Sphinx]
automation via `pip install ansible-pygments sphinx`. Then, you should
be able to use a lexer by its name `ansible-output` in the code blocks
of your RST documents. For example:

```rst
.. code-block:: ansible-output

    [WARNING]: Unable to find '/nosuchfile' in expected paths (use -vvvvv to see paths)

    ok: [localhost] => {
        "msg": ""
    }
```

## Using the style in [Sphinx]

It is possible to just set `ansible` in `conf.py` and it will "just
work", provided that this project is installed alongside [Sphinx] as
shown above.

```python
pygments_style = 'ansible'
```
